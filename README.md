# NLP_Practice: Article Feature Extraction and Entity Extraction

## Overview
This project focuses on processing unstructured article data and extracting meaningful features for analysis. It consists of two main components:
1. **Article Feature Extraction**: Processes a dataset of article URLs, extracts key features, and generates a structured output file.
2. **Entity Extraction**: Takes the structured output file from the first step and performs named entity recognition (NER) to identify entities like people, organizations, and locations.

## Features

### 1. Article Feature Extraction
- **Input**: An Excel file with a column named `URL` containing article links.
- **Output**: A new Excel file with the following columns:
  - `News Source`: The website of the article.
  - `Header`: The article's headline.
  - `Text`: Cleaned and concatenated body text.
  - `Authors`: A cleaned list of authors.

This notebook prepares data for further processing in the **Entity Extraction** step.

### 2. Entity Extraction
- **Input**: The structured Excel file generated by the **Article Feature Extraction** step.
- **Output**: An enriched dataset with entities such as:
  - People
  - Organizations
  - Locations

This step uses **spaCy** for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

## Workflow
1. **Run Article Feature Extraction**:
   - Place your input Excel file (containing a `URL` column) in the project directory.
   - Open and execute the `Article_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` notebook to generate the structured Excel file.
   - Example input: `articles.xlsx`
   - Example output: `prepared_articles.xlsx`

2. **Run Entity Extraction**:
   - Use the structured Excel file from the first step as input.
   - Open and execute the `Entity_Extraction.ipynb` notebook to identify named entities in the article text.
   - Example input: `prepared_articles.xlsx`
   - Example output: `entities_extracted.xlsx`

## Requirements
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`
  - `numpy`
  - `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`)
  - `re`
  - `spaCy`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mpdaniels414/NLP_Practice.git
   cd NLP_Practice
   
2. Install SpaCy.  Note this needs to be done directly in the terminal.  
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
